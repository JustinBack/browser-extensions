Stand-alone HTML popup for [Terms of Service; Didn't Read](https://tosdr.org).

Add the URL to a service as a query param "url" like so: `http://didnotread.github.com/browser-extensions/popup/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitpic.com%2Ffoo`. The value must be URL component encoded (in JavaScript it would be `encodeURIComponent('http://twitpic.com/foo')`).
