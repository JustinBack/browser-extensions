# Below is our extension privacy policy

When the extension loads, it will retrieve one big file with all data from https://tosdr.org. 


Your IP address will temporarily be visible in our hosters' web access logs (pixelcatproductions.net), as well as to Hetzner who provide infrastructure.


Our CDN does not collect any IPs.


Additionally, when opening a popup the service data gets retrieved with all points and documents in it.

We also check for extension updates by calling our updatecheck api which is hosted on the same api server. (This can be disabled)

To display small images of a service's rating, we contact our shields server at shields.tosdr.org. This can be disabled in the settings.

The extension also displays hyperlinks to our website, but that will not affect your privacy if  you  don't actively click on them.

Other than that, installing this extensions does not expose information to us or to any of the websites you visit.
